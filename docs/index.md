# Welcome to Sustainable Supply Information eXchange (SSIX)

Sustainability is an essential concern for all businesses globally. It encompasses how natural systems work, continue to be diverse and yield everything required for the environment to remain in balance and in the future.

There are **three pillars of sustainability: economic development, social development and environmental protection**. *Economic development* refers to giving people what they wish for without negotiating the quality of life and reducing the financial weight of doing what is right. *Social development* is about the mindfulness and legal protection of human health from pollution and toxic activities of businesses and organizations, as well as upholding access to basic natural resources without compromising the quality of life. *Environmental protection* focuses on how ecosystems should be both studied and protected, and how technology can help ensure a greener future.

## Supply

Supply of commodities and goods plays a huge part in all three aspects of sustainability. OFten, much has been made of the negative impacts of supply on sustainability but with increased awareness and growing legislation, it has never been more important for supply networks to be sustainable.

## Data

A huge part of achieving sustainability is through the exchange of information throughout the network partners so understanding of the sustainability of any given supply chain can be achieved and any adjustments made to achieve sustainability.

As such, this technical protocol defines what information should be exchanged between parties and passed along the supply chain in order to help participants achieve their sustainability goals.

## Timber

Initially the protocol has been designed with the supply of timber and wood based products but has been deliberately created with both common components and extension points in order to be able to accomodate any commodity.
