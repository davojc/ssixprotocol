# SSIX Mission

## SSIX Protocol Communitiy is built around clear standards.

The whole purpose of the protocol is to form the fabric of sustainable supply. SSIX connects the global ecosystem of suppliers in sustainable goods with a clear focus on the prevention of deforestation. This is accomplished by the following key principles:

1. Creating and maintaining robust open standards for information exchange across the whole ecosystem.
2. Providing advice and counsel to regulatory bodies in a transparent and unbiased way.
3. Seeking ways to improve the supply process for global industries facing sustainability challenges.
4. Provide members with a neutral, collaborative environment to come together through member-driven conferences and other critical forums to promote, support and educate.
