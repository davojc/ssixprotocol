# What is SSIX?

## Sustainable Supply Information eXchange (SSIX) Protocol

The Sustainable Supply Information eXchange (SSIX) Protocol is technical standard designed to faciliate the digital trade of goods and in particular those requiring sustainable management.

The SSIX messaging standard is owned, maintained and developed through the collaborative efforts of SSIX Community member firms. These firms work together to ensure that the standard continues to meet emerging requirements and to promote its increased adoption, which presents huge benefits across the community.
